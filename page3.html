                  <p>The Bombyx mori, commonly known as the domestic silk moth or silkworm moth, is a pivotal species in the global silk industry, originating from China and domesticated for over 5,000 years.
                     This moth, which has a wingspan of 3 to 4 inches and a soft, white or cream-colored body, plays a crucial role in silk production. 
                     Its larvae, known as silkworms, are raised on mulberry leaves and spin cocoons made from continuous silk threads. These cocoons are harvested to produce raw silk, renowned for its softness, strength, and luster.
                      The life cycle of the Bombyx mori includes distinct stages: eggs, larvae, pupae, and adult moths, with the latter primarily focused on reproduction and not feeding. 
                      Sericulture, the cultivation of silkworms, requires precise environmental control and care to ensure high-quality silk. 
                      Beyond its economic value, silk has deep cultural significance, symbolizing luxury and craftsmanship across various cultures. 
                      Although the Bombyx mori itself is not at risk, sustainable sericulture practices are essential for minimizing environmental impact and preserving the silk's exceptional quality.</p>

                  <p>The skull-headed hawk moth (Sphinx ligustri) is a striking and fascinating species known for its distinctive appearance and impressive behavior.
                     This moth, native to Europe and parts of Asia, is named for the eerie skull-like pattern on its thorax, which resembles a human skull. It has a robust, streamlined body and large, powerful wings that allow for agile flight. 
                     The moth's forewings are a mottled brown and gray, while its hindwings are adorned with vibrant orange and black markings. The skull-headed hawk moth is a nocturnal species and is often attracted to lights, where it can be observed feeding on nectar from a variety of flowers. 
                     Its caterpillars, or larvae, are equally notable, with a green or brown body and a horn-like projection on their tail. These larvae feed on a range of plants, including privet and honeysuckle, before pupating in the soil. 
                     The species is known for its rapid and erratic flight patterns, which are used to evade predators and search for food. With its striking appearance and interesting behaviors, the skull-headed hawk moth is a subject of fascination for both entomologists and nature enthusiasts.</p>

                  <img src="/class images/Comet Moth.png" class="image">
                  <p>The comet moth (Argema mittrei), also known as the comet swallowtail, is an extraordinary and visually captivating species native to Madagascar. 
                    Renowned for its striking appearance, the comet moth features large, yellow wings adorned with red and orange markings, and long, elegant tail streamers that can extend up to 12 inches, resembling the tail of a comet. 
                    This moth is one of the largest and most colorful in the world, with a wingspan that can reach up to 8 inches. The comet moth is nocturnal and primarily attracts mates through its vibrant colors and pheromones. 
                    Its larvae, or caterpillars, feed on a variety of host plants, including those in the citrus and cashew families, and are green with a series of distinctive white or yellow spots. After undergoing metamorphosis, the adult moth emerges with a brief but spectacular life cycle, focusing on reproduction. 
                    The comet moth's mesmerizing appearance and impressive size make it a popular subject of fascination and study among entomologists and butterfly enthusiasts alike.</p>
