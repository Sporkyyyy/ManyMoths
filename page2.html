                    <p>This cute little guy is probably what you think of when someone mentions a moth.
                        tineola bisselliella, also known as the common clothes moth, is a small moth and is widely
                        considered a pest due to them eating holes into those old clothes in your closet, but did you know
                        its not actually the moth eating your clothes? its actually the larva!
                        When these little guys are catterpillers they get all their nourishment from wool and many
                        other natural fibres. The catterpillers take from 1 month to up to 2 years until their pupal stage is reached and they
                        start to spin their cacoons and take another 10-50 days to turn into adults!<br>Once the moth is ready it emerges from the cacoon and begins searching for a mate.
                        Did you know this species prefer to walk over flying? Some choose not to fly at all!
                        Once the moth as found a mate the female will lay between 30 to 200 eggs after which she will die, tough life huh?
                        If a moth doesnt mate it will live for 15-30 days.</p>

                    <p>The rosy maple moth, scientifically known as Dryocampa rubicunda, is a bright and adorable
                        silk moth found in the US and Canada. As their name suggests the catterpillers of these adorable moths feed on maple leaves!
                        The larvae hatch and live on the save tree all throughout their development and then pupate in the soil below.
                        This moth, from egg to adulthood typically lives for about 2 to 9 months.
                        
                        Rosy Maple Moth exhibit sexual dismorphism, a conidition where the males and females have different morphological features.
                        The male Maple moth has narrow, less rounded wings and bipectinate antennae.</p>

                    <img src="/class images/luna moth.png" class="image">
                    <p>Actias luna, aka, the Luna moth is part of the giant silk moth family, its beautiful bright green wings can be found all over Canada.
                        This amazing moth is unique with its defence mechanisms, as a larvae it emits clicks as a warning and can also regurgitate its intestines, 
                        as an adult the hindwings confuse the echolocation detection used by its predetors.</p>
