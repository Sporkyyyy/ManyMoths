<b>Common clothes moth:</b>
This cute little guy is probably what you think of when someone mentions a moth.
tineola bisselliella, also known as the common clothes moth, is a small moth and is widely
considered a pest due to them eating holes into those old clothes in your closet, but did you know
its not actually the moth eating your clothes? its actually the larva!
When these little guys are catterpillers they get all their nourishment from wool and many
other natural fibres. The catterpillers take from 1 month to up to 2 years until their pupal stage is reached and they
start to spin their cacoons and take another 10-50 days to turn into adults!

Once the moth is ready it emerges from the cacoon and begins searching for a mate.
Did you know this species prefer to walk over flying? Some choose not to fly at all!
Once the moth as found a mate the female will lay between 30 to 200 eggs after which she will die, tough life huh?
If a moth doesnt mate it will live for 15-30 days.
